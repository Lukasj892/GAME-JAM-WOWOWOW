# Project Name
Froot Friends, November 2022

## Theme
We are saving food from being eaten by an evil capsule.

## Game Play
Move around and creep around corners to avoid being caught and eaten by the capule.

## Impediments
AI Scripting

## Implementation
Player can find keys used to open the door to escape.

Player is in first person. Use the mouse to look around, WASD to move, hold Q or E to peak around corners, and hold shift to sprint.

The Capsule will slowly move in the player's direction.
